This is an example Space Invaders emulator in C that shows the usage of the Z80 CPU emulator CMZ80, which is in a different project in my repository. 
This is a fairly barebones emulator, but does include fully working emulation. The folder also includes a I8080 class if you want to use the real CPU that Space Invaders used.

This is just meant as an example for how to use the Z80 as Space Invaders was the easiest example. Place the Space Invaders Roms (not included) in the invaders directory and have fun.
